# Covid-19-Cases-Prediction-Using-LSTM
Final submission for Afretec Summer School in Smart Systems. We developed a deep learning module using PyTorch to predict COVID-19 cases. Utilizing an LSTM neural network, the model analyzes time-series data for forecasting. The project underscores the importance of data preprocessing and LSTM networks in sequential data analysis.
